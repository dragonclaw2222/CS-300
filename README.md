# CS-300
For this project we were making a program that can sort a list of classes in alphabetical order
I chose to solve this problem using a vector as I felt it was the most appropriate for a list of classes 
working out the proper math to give the prerequisites was very difficult for me and took numerous tries before I succeeded 
I feel this was a excellent exercise in C++ and feel like I learned a compressive amount about the effective use of vectors 
This program showed me I should use more self comments cause after hitting roadblocks it is confusing to sort back through the lines to search for issues.
